### 1. Run the Server

Run the server by executing the command `python server.py` in one terminal window.

### 2. Run the Client

Run the client by executing the command `python client.py` in another terminal window.

### What to Expect

The client will generate a file called `chains.txt` with the specified number of chains (default is 1 million).

The client will send the chains to the server, which will process them and send the responses back to the client.

The client will store the responses in a file called `responses.txt`.
